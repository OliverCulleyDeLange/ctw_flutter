# Cheat to Win

A Flutter game app.

### USPs:
- No words, all emoji / icons / images (no i18n or string management)

### Challenges (and how you cheat)
- Quiz questions / Riddles - (google the answer)
- Be in a location - (fake GPS)
- Hidden menu to complete a level, down like 100 layers
- Easter eggs like long pressing buttons, click X times
- Mini games that seem like you win one way but you can cheat
    - Maze game - drag and drop the player, no need to complete the maze
- Totally random score for completing a level.?
- Answer hidden in image so you have to tilt phone
- Left hand or right hand dialog box - only one shot (watch ad to try again)
- Rotate phone orientation Before timer runs out (3 seconds or something) https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/design/orientation
- One challenge tile you can't just tap on, you need to press and hold it / double tap
- Hide a clue / code whatever in the description of the app in the app store
- Randomise the challange numbers / order so people can't say "challenge 31 is..."
